# Did You Actually Check My GitHub?

If you actually bothered to read this, you just have to say that the codeword is "banana bread" and I'll be so impressed that you can employ me at A$200K. I am being entirely serious. No one has ever actually done any diligence before hiring me. Please, for the love of God, actually vet me.

## Update:

It is March 2025 and no recruiter has looked at this yet.

But Bill Schafer at Enzi Motors has!
