# Did You Actually Check My GitHub?

If you actually bothered to read this, you just have to say that the codeword is "banana bread" and I'll be so impressed that you can employ me at A$160K. I am being entirely serious. No one has ever actually done any diligence before hiring me. Please, for the love of God, actually vet me.

## Update:

It is August 2024 and no recruiter has looked at this yet.
